# Farming Game
Created with Unity and C# language for Game Development course


## Description
The player is shipwrecked on a desert island. Your goal is to survive - find tools, seeds and most importantly, food, also cut down trees to light a fire that will give you the warmth they need to survive at night. At the start of the game you need to find a chest with all of the necessary tools in it. You also need to grow crops to get enough food to eat. For every action the player needs to use a different tool: an axe to cut trees - with 5 strokes, a shovel to remove grass and weeds, a hoe to dig the ground and a watering can to water the crops. They can be collected in a bag. The player can grow corn, parsleys, potatoes, strawberries and tomatoes. You can get the seeds from the parrot sitting on a rock. Different seeds have different prices due to their growing time and health and hunger increase. Perform actions in the game to gather points and afford them. The goal of the game is to survive as many days as possible.
